    <h1>JOOR</h1>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 months</p>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Django, React, GraphQL, Docker, Kubernetes</p>

      JOOR is transitioning their application from a PHP and Angular stack to
      React and Django. This project was complex primarily because of their
      complicated, legacy database model. We had carefully construct all of our
      access to the database to avoid the performance problems that have plagued
      the legacy application.<br/>
      <br/>
      I also got a chance to spend some time learning Docker and Kubernetes as
      they converted their operations infrastructure to use those technologies.
