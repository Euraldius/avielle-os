      Qchatspace will be a chat application for queer teens to explore their
      identities and ask questions in a safe, moderated space. For two weeks as
      a pro bono thoughtbot project I
      built the interface for users to sign up and interact with Rocketchat,
      where the chats would take place. After that, I continued to lead the
      development of the application for 9 months in my spare time before
      handing it off to the contractors who are now finishing the work.<br/>
      <br/>
      I built in the app in Django despite having more experience in Rails
      because Django had already been vetted by Planned Parenthood's security
      team, and the application will be hosted on PP's servers.
