    <h1>Groupon</h1>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 7 weeks</p>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Ruby on Rails, Angular, Node</p>

      Groupon acquired an event ticketing startup, and we helped them integrate
      it into their existing site. The bulk of my work involved writing
      integrations between the new ticketing infrastructure and APIs provided by
      Ticketmaster, Stubhub, and other event ticketing sites. The Node and
      Angular infrastructure was all written in a homegrown and unmaintained
      fork of Coffeescript, which provided its own uniqueâ€¦challenges.
