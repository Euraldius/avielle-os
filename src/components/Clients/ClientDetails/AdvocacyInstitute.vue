      Advocacy Institute hired me for a short engagement to debug a memory leak
      (which ultimately was coming from an enormous amount of Ruby strings
      created by parsing huge JSON blobs stored in Postgres). Because of the
      politicly active nature of AI's work, I had a lot of fun on this project
      and made some lasting friends.
