      We built the React frontend for the first version of Mammosphere, a
      mammogram viewing application. We had to work closely with the lifeIMAGE
      engineering team that built the Java backend to make a tight deadline.
      To meet the deadline, we had to be strict about avoiding feature bloat,
      and were careful to regularly demo to stakeholders so they understood the
      challenges we faced and the progress we were making.
