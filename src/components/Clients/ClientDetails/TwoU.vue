      2U brought me on to reinforce best practices in a new Ruby on Rails
      application that would replace the legacy system that ran their graduate
      program application service. Using both my own code and code reviews, I
      began discussions on how to avoid technical debt and establish a positive
      culture of good code. The devs on this team were a delight to work with!
