      I worked with the Shutterstock Editor team to build the first version of
      their in-house photo editing service. This was the technically complex
      project I had worked on at that time. The backend was built in Node, the frontend
      menu UIs were built in React, and the editor component itself was built
      using HTML Canvas.
