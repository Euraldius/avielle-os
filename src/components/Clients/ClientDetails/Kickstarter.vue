    <h2>Kickstarter</h2>
    <p>
      From January to April of 2018, I worked with a 5 person team to rebuild
      Kickstarter's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/306741842/fruitcake-issue-2">project page</a>.
      It was previously constructed from a Rails RESTful API backend and a
      Javascript mishmash frontend (including Angular, Ember, and raw
      JS/jQuery). We rebuilt it in React, using GraphQL to communicate with the
      Rails backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      2 of the developers on the team were junior, and one of the most enjoyable
      aspects of the work was mentoring them. At thoughtbot, I mentored
      <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/playbook/our-company/apprenticeship">apprentices</a>.
      Helping junior devs skill up, especially when they are from
      underrepresented groups in tech, has always been rewarding both at
      thoughtbot and on client projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most challenging part of the project was handling the shifting
      priorities coming from the executive level. I worked closely with the
      product manager for the project to ensure the team always had valuable,
      well-written stories to pick up.
