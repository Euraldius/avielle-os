      Harry's hired us to help them move their frontend to React. The dev lead I
      worked with was invested in skilling up junior developers from diverse
      backgrounds, so I advised him based on my experiences as both an
      apprentice and as a mentor in thoughtbot's apprenticeship program. A few
      months after I rolled off the project, he let me know they had the program
      up and running!
