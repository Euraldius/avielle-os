    <h1>Anheuser</h1>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 weeks</p>
    <p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Django REST framework</p>
    <p><strong>Site:</strong>&nbsp;N/A (project canceled)</p>

      Anheuser contracted us to create an alcohol delivery service a la Drizly.
      The best part of this project was a week long trip to Mexico City to work
      with the team there to design the application. We used thoughtbot's <a
        href="https://thoughtbot.com/product-design-sprint/guide">design
        sprint</a>, which I'd previously been taught as an apprentice. I loved
      the challenge of navigating the needs of different stakeholders and
      designing an application that met all of them without committing ourselves
      to an unrealistic scope. We were going to build the backend with Django
      REST framework and the frontend in React, but we had only begun work on
      the API when the project was canceled.
